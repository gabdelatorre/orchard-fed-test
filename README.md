# Orchard FED Test
![Vercel Deploy](https://deploy-badge.vercel.app/vercel/orchard-fed-test-zeta)

Deployed URL: https://orchard-fed-test-zeta.vercel.app/

## Tools Used
- React
- NextJS
  - This React framework was used as it has tons of features that can be easily used without going through the hassle of setting them up individually. This provided us a generated React project that is already setup with Tailwind, TypeScript, Webpack for build, and Vercel for deployment.
- Tailwind
  - Due to its seamless integration with NextJS, it made sense to use Tailwind as the CSS framework for this project. Due to its simplicity, it was a breeze in using pre-defined utility classes without having to create CSS files per components.
- React Spring
  - This React library is used to give some fun animations in the page.
